# HTML5-CSS-JS
This is an initial self-learn project containing solutions of tasks, which completion was neccessary to receive a positive grade from subject "Języki skryptowe - HTML5 i JavaScript" in my first year of studies at University of Gdańsk .

Each one of folders contains an individual and separate topic with assignment to complete independently by students.
Furthermore the content of each task is written in polish language and placed in a .docx file named "Summary".
